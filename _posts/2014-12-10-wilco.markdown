<p>With a bit of luck due to a collegue having a spare ticket, I managed to make it to an awesome <a href="http://wilcoworld.net">Wilco</a> show at <a href="http://jamusa.com/riviera-theatre/">The Riviera</a> in Uptown.</p>
<p>This concert was part of a set a six shows. Tweedy and the band were fast, and loose, and wonderful, and totally beloved by the home crowd. An truly outstanding show, and a great evening.</p>
<p>Also: I should get out more often. Last <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2005/11/02#wilco_20051101">blog entry about Wilco</a> was from 2005. Ouch.</p>
