<p>The <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/package=inline">inline</a> package facilitates writing code <em>in-line</em> in simple string expressions or short files. The package is mature and in maintenance mode: <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> used it greatly for several years but then moved on to Rcpp Attributes so we have a much limited need for extensions to inline.</p>
<p>But we now have a new inline version 0.3.14. It brings both a few minor code updates since the last release in 2013, but also new extensions to both support Fortran better (for several flavours including f95) and to make working with dynamic library files easier. These were contributed by long-time R author <a href="https://www.nioz.nl/staff-detail?id=784400">Karline Soetaert</a> who thereby became a package co-author. Also, the package moved to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> sometime last year and now lives <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/inline">in this repo</a>.</p>
<p>See below for a detailed list of changes extracted from the <code>NEWS</code> file.</p>
