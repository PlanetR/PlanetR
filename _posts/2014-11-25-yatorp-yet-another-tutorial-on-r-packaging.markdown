<p>What the world needs right now is <it>yet another tutorial on R packages</it> and their creation. Luckily, this last Friday and Saturday, I had the opportunity to present in a workshop organized by <a href="http://www.ditraglia.com/">Frank DiTraglia</a> at Penn's shiny new <a href="http://warrencenter.upenn.edu/">Warren Center</a>, and held at <a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton</a>.</p>
<p>Given the Warren Center's focus, the workshop centered around Big Data and Open Science with R. <a href="http://yihui.name/">Yihui Xie</a> and myself alternated on delivering four units on an Introduction to R, Writing R packages, Dynamic Documents with R, and HPC with Rcpp and RcppArmadillo.</p>
<p>So I had to come up with a plan for teaching <it>creating R packages</it> -- and decided to do it from the very bottom up, clearly introducing the underlying <code>R CMD ...</code> commands and only then switching to taking advantage of an environment such as the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio IDE</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/papers/r_package_development_nov2014.pdf">slides</a> are now available on my <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/presentations.html">presentations page</a>. The code examples are in a <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/samplecode/tree/master/penn-2014-11">repo subdirectory on GitHub</a> as well. While both were designed to support the parallel live instruction offered in the workshop, I would be interested in feedback (preferably via email) about how useful the slides are by themselves.</p>
