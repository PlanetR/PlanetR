<p>A week ago, <a href="http://conradsanderson.id.au/">Conrad</a> provided another minor release 4.550.0 of <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> which has since received one minor correction in 4.550.1.0. As before, I had created a GitHub-only pre-release of his pre-release which was tested against the almost one hundred <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> dependents of our <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a> package. This passed fine as usual, and results are as always in the <a href="https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs">rcpp-logs</a> repository.</p>
<p>Processing and acceptance at the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> took a little longer as around the same time a fresh failure in unit tests had become apparent on an as-of-yet unannounced new architecture (!!) also tested at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. The R-devel release has since gotten a new <code>capabilities()</code> test for <code>long double</code>, and we now only run this test (for our <code>rmultinom()</code>) if the test asserts that the given R build has this capability. Phew, so with all that the new version in now on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>; Windows binaries have been built and I also uploaded new <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> binaries.</p>
<p>Changes are summarized below; our end also includes added support for conversion of <code>Field</code> types takes to short pull request by Romain.</p>
