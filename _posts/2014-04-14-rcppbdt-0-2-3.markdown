A new release of the <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.bdt.html">RcppBDT</a> package is now on CRAN. 

<p></p>
Several new modules were added; the package can now work on dates, date
durations, "ptime" (aka posix time), and timezones.  Most interesting may be
the fact that ptime is configured to use 96 bits. This allows a precise representation
of dates and times down to nanoseconds, and permits date and time
calculations at this level.

<p></p>
The complete NEWS entry is below:

<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Changes in version 0.2.3 (2014-04-13)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p> New module 'bdtDt' replacing the old 'bdtDate' module in a more transparent style using a local class which is wrapped, just like the three other new classes do </p> </li>
  <li><p> New module 'bdtTd' providing date durations which can be added to dates. </p> </li>
  <li><p> New module 'bdtTz' providing time zone information such as offset to UTC, amount of DST, abbreviated and full timezone names. </p> </li>
  <li><p> New module 'bdtDu' using 'posix_time::duration' for time durations types </p> </li>
  <li><p> New module 'bdtPt' using 'posix_time::ptime' for posix time, down to nanosecond granularity (where hardware and OS permit it) </p> </li>
  <li><p> Now selects C++11 compilation by setting <code>CXX_STD = CXX11</code> in <code>src/Makevars*</code> and hence depend on R 3.1.0 or
  later &ndash; this gives gives us <code>long long</code> needed for the nano-second high-resolution time calculations across all builds and platforms. </p> </li>
</ul>

is also a diffstat report
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/2014/04/13#RcppBDT_0.2.3">for the lastest release</a>.
As always, feedback is welcome and the 
<a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel">rcpp-devel mailing list</a>
off the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rcpp/">R-Forge page for Rcpp</a> is
the best place to start a discussion.

<strong>Update:</strong> I just learned the hard way that the combination of
32-bit OS, g++ at version 4.7 or newer and a Boost version of 1.53 or 1.54 does
not work with this new upload.  Some Googling suggests that this ought to be
fixed in Boost 1.54; seemingly it isn't as our trusted
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/bh.html">BH</a> package with Boost
headers provides that very version 1.54. However, the Googling also
suggested a quick two-line fix which I just
<a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/bh/commit/e0990ebdb3b813c09d0b27021c1d5c79aaff48f3" >committed in the Github repo</a>.
A new <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/bh.html">BH</a> package with
the fix may follow in a few days.
