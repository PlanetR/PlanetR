A new minor / bug fix release 4.300.8 of
<a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a>, the
templated C++ library for linear algebra, was tagged by
<a href="http://conradsanderson.id.au/">Conrad</a> in his SVN repo a few days ago,
following earlier snapshots in the 4.300.* series.

<p></p>
We had prepared two earlier releases for GitHub but not CRAN in order to accomodate the CRAN
maintainer's desire of <it>"a release every one to two months"</it> expressed in the
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN Repo Policy</a>.
However, two actual bugs in the interaction between MinGW and C++11 were reported on the
rcpp-devel mailing list, and this releases addresses these. Hence time for new release 0.4.300.8.0 of 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a>
which is now on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> and in
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>.

<p></p>
This release brings a few upstream changes detailed below such as
nice new upstream changes such as more robust <code>norm()</code> (and related) functions,
and fixes related to matrix and cube interactions.  From our end, we added a better
detection of Windows via both <code>_WIN32</code> and <code>WIN32</code> (as the former
apparently gets undefined by MinGW in C++11 mode). We also added the ability to turn on C++11
support from R (possible since R 3.1.0) yet also turn it off for Armadillo.  This is needed as
the prescribed compiler on Windows is g++ 4.6.2 -- which offers a subset of C++11 which is
good enough for a number of things from the C++11 standard, but not advanced enough for
everything which Armadillo uses when C++11 support is turned on.  As
Armadillo continues to offer a choice of C++ standards, we can use the ability to deploy C++11
only outside of its internals.  It is worth repeating that this issue should only affect
Windows users wishing to use C++11; other platforms are fine as they generally have more
modern compilers.
