After two pre-releases in the last few days,
<a href="http://conradsanderson.id.au/">Conrad</a> finalised a new 
<a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> version 4.400 today.
I had kept up with the pre-releases, tested twice against all eighty (!!) 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> dependents of 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a>
and have hence uploaded RcppArmadillo 0.4.400.0 to 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> and into
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>.


<p></p>
This release brings a number of new upstream features which are detailed
below. As included is s bugfix for sparse matrix creation at the
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a>
end which was found by the ASAN tests at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> ---
which are similar to the <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/08/03#sanitizers_0.1.0">sanitizers</a>
tests I recently blogged.  I was able to develop and test the fix in the very
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/sanitizers.html">docker r-devel-san images</a>
I had written about which was nice. Special thanks also to Ryan Curtin for help
with the fix.
