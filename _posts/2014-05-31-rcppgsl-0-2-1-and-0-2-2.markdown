A few days ago, version 0.2.1 of
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.gsl.html">RcppGSL</a>---our
interface package between
<a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU GSL</a> using our
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> package for
seamless R and C++ integration---appeared on
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> making it the first release in
some time.

<p></p>
And it turned that this version tickled an obscure and long-dormant bug under
clang which was found on OS X Mavericks---which <a href="http://kevinushey.github.io/">Kevin Ushey</a>
consequently squashed. So this is now reflected in version 0.2.2 which just
arrived on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>.

<p></p>

Besides the bugfix, a few things were modernized to reflect capabilities 
of <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> 0.11.0
and later.  The releases also contain a few changes that had accumulated
since the previous release in 2012 such as an additional example using
B-splines, and use of updated vignette build options provided by R.

<p></p>
The NEWS file entries follows below:

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Changes in version 0.2.2 (2014-05-31)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p> A subtle bug (tickled only by clang on some OS versions) in vector and matrix view initialization was corrected by Kevin Ushey </p> </li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes in version 0.2.1 (2014-05-26)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p> Added new example based on B-splines example in GSL manual illustrating simple GSL use via Rcpp attributes </p> </li>
  <li><p> Vignette compilation has been reverted to using <span class="pkg">highlight</span> since version 0.4.2 or greater can be used as a vignette engine (with R 3.0.* or later). </p> </li>
  <li><p> Vignette compilation is now being done by <code>R CMD build</code> as R 3.0.0 supports different vignette engines, so the vignette build process has been simplified. A convenience helper script has also been added for command-line builds. </p> </li>
  <li><p> Unit tests now use <code>sourceCpp()</code> instead of <code>cxxfunction()</code> from the <span class="pkg">inline</span> package </p> </li>
  <li><p> The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file now uses <code>Suggests: Rcpp</code> (instead of <code>Depends: Rcpp</code>) to permit building of the vignette </p> </li>
  <li><p> The package now takes advantage of the simplified build process available with Rcpp (&gt;= 0.11.0) </p> </li>
  <li><p> Similar updates to the build process were made for the example package included with RcppGSL </p> </li>
</ul>
