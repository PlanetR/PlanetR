This is an updated version of <a
href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/03/27#rcpp_talks_spring_summer_2014">an
earlier post</a> in March.

<p></p>
A number of talks about <a href="http://www.rcpp.org">Rcpp</a> are scheduled
over the next couple of months:

<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>On Wednesday May 14 I will be speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/">Chicago R Users Group</a>
    meeting charmingly titled <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/events/178275732/">Warm Up for R/Finance</a>, along with
    fellow R/Finance organizer <a href="http://about.me/joshuaulrich">Josh
    Ulrich</a>, fellow R/Finance regular Kent Hosxey as well as Cliff
    Clive. I will talk about <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> and my rather recent nascent
    <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppredis">RcppRedis</a> package. 
  </li>
  
  <p></p>
  <li>Our sixth international conference <a href="http://www.RinFinance.com">R/Finance</a>
  will take place May 16 and 17, 2014, at UIC in Chicago. See the current
  <a href="http://www.RinFinance.com/agenda">agenda</a> for details of the program---which
  once again will be preceded by one-hour workshops. And as in the past, I will offer a one-hour
  gentle introduction to <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a>.  This workshop requires
  registration and a fee, and registraion will close shortly.

  I will also present a short <em>lightning talk</em> about the
  <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppredis">RcppRedis</a> package
  as part of the conference proper.
  </li>

  <p></p>
  <li>A few days later, on May 20, 2014, I will present a one-hour <emph>webinar</emph> which is part of a series
  organized by Ray DiGiacomo and the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3826973">Orange County R Users Group</a>.
  See <a href="http://liondatasystems.com/events">this page</a> for details and registration
  information; the talk itself will be free of charge.
  </li>

  <p></p>
  <li>Later in the month, on May 30, 2014, I will give a talk / guest lecture about
  <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> and
  <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html">RcppArmadillo</a> and
  over in Economics at the University of Chicago.  I reckon that this event is not open to anybody
  not part of U of C.
  </li>

  <p></p>
  <li>Another three-hour tutorial is scheduled for the tutorial day preceding
  <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/#tutorials">useR! 2014</a> at UCLA in early July. This tutorial will
  also require registration as part of the <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu">annual useR! conference</a>.

  I am very honoured to have been asked to give one of the 
  <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/#invited">invited keynotes</a> at
  <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/">useR! 2014</a>. The talk may (or may not) cover at least some aspects
  of Rcpp.

  As my talk proposal about the recent
  <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppziggurat">RcppZiggurat</a>
  package for faster Normal RNGs was accepted, I will also give a regular
  conference talk.
  </li>

</ul>

<p></p>
So the month of June remains pretty open.  If someone wants me to talk somewhere else, preferably on a
Saturday, feel free to get in touch.
