<p>A brand new and shiny version of rfoaas is now on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. The rfoaas package provides an interface for <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> to the most excellent <a href="http://www.foaas.com">FOAAS</a> service--which provides a modern, scalable and RESTful web service for the frequent need to tell someone to f$#@ off.</p>
<p>There are two (internal) changes of merit in this version. First off, as <a href="http://www.foaas.com">FOAAS</a> was refactored upstream, we are now <em>forced</em> to supply an <code>accept: text/plain</code> http request header. Which, sadly enough, is not something the <code>url()</code> function in R can do---so we brought in more cavalry and now depend on the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/httr">httr</a> package by <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley</a>, and use its <code>GET()</code> method. A second change is that we added a (simple but effective enough) regression test which simply calls all foaas entry points available throug rfoaas, and compares this to the anticipated result. To run it, you need to set an environment variable <code>RunFOAASTests=yes</code> as eg out <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rfoaas/blob/master/.travis.yml">Travis script</a> does. Finally, we aligned the version number with upstream to signal that we cover all available entry points of that version.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/">CRANberries</a> provides a <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/2015/01/11#rfoaas_0.1.1">diff to the previous release</a>. Questions, comments etc should go to the <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rfoaas/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>
