<p>A new release of the <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.cnpy.html">RcppCNPy</a> package is now on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>.</p>
<p>This release mostly solidifies and fixes things. Support for saving integer objects, which was expanded in <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/04/10#rcppcnpy_0.2.3">release 0.2.3</a>, was not entirely correct. Operations on big-endian systems were not up to snuff either.</p>
<p>Wush Wu helped in getting this right with very diligent testing and patching particularly on big-endian hardware. We also got a pull request from Romain to reflect better const correctness at the Rcpp side of things. Last but not least we obliged by the CRAN Maintainers to not assume one could call <code>gzip</code> from <code>system()</code> call because, well, you guessed it.</p>

<h4>
Changes in version 0.2.4 (2015-01-05)
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p> 
Support for saving integer objects was not correct and has been fixed.
</p> </li>
<li><p> 
Support for loading and saving on 'big endian' systems was incomplete, has been greatly expanded and corrected, thanks in large part to very diligent testing as well as patching by Wush Wu.
</p> </li>
<li><p> 
The implementation now uses const iterators, thanks to a pull request by Romain Francois.
</p> </li>
<li><p> 
The vignette no longer assumes that one can call <code>gzip</code> via <code>system</code> as the world's leading consumer OS may disagree.
</p> </li>
</ul>
