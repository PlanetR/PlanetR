Yesterday's release of <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/04/13#rcppbdt_0.2.3">RcppBDT 0.2.3</a>
lead to an odd build error. If one used at the same time a 32-bit OS, a
compiler as recent as g++ 4.7 and the Boost 1.54.0 headers (directly or via
the BH package) then the file <code>lexical_cast.hpp</code> barked and failed to
compile for lack of an 128-bit  integer (which is not a surprise on a 32-bit OS).

<p></p>
After looking at this for a bit, and looking at some related bug report, I
came up with a simple fix (which I mentioned in an update to the
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/04/13#rcppbdt_0.2.3">RcppBDT 0.2.3 release post</a>).
Sleeping over it, and comparing to the Boost 1.55 file, showed that the hunch
was right, and I have since made a new release 1.54.0-2 of the 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/bh.html">BH</a> package which
contains the fix.

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Changes in version 1.54.0-2 (2014-04-14)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p> Bug fix to <code>lexical_cast.hpp</code> which now uses the test for INT128 which the rest of Boost uses, consistent with Boost 1.55 too. </p> </li>
</ul>
