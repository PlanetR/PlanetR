A new minor release 0.11.2 of 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> is now
on the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> network for
<a href="http://www.r-project.org">GNU R</a>, and binaries for 
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> have also been uploaded.

<p></p>
The release smoothes a few edges on both the 
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> side itself, as well
as on the interaction between
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> and 
<a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> which since release 3.1.0 offers a
few new features related to C++11.

<p></p>
<a href="http://kevinushey.github.io/">Kevin</a> added a couple of neat
extensions related to vectors, a new <code>ListOf</code> templated
list class, as well as a new option to warn on implicit casts. We decided not
to make this option the default as it may be too common in some packages.  JJ took
care of a few buglets related to the wonderful Rcpp Attributes. See the NEWS
file section below for details, or the ChangeLog file in the package and on the  
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.changelog.html">Rcpp Changelog page</a>.
Note that the <code>diffstat</code> reported by CRANberries is very large as
Kevin also committed a whitespace cleanup which touched almost all files.

<p></p>
As before, we tested this release by building against all
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> packages
which depend upon <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a>. In fact we did
three such runs leading up to the release. Only one package was blacklisted
(as I currently don't have CUDA set-up), two had what may be internal errors
or tests which were too restrictive, sixteen suffered from missing packages
or RGL devices  --- but the remaining 202 packages all built and tested 
cleanly. Detailed results of those tests (and the scripts for it) are <a
href="https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs">in the rcpp-logs repo GitHub</a>.  

<p></p>
There are a number of other fixes, upgrades and other extensions detailed in
<code>NEWS</code> file extract below, in the ChangeLog file in the package and on the  
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.changelog.html">Rcpp Changelog page</a>.

<blockquote>
<h4>Changes in Rcpp version 0.11.2 (2014-06-06</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p> Changes in Rcpp API: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p> Implicit conversions, e.g. between <code>NumericVector</code> and
      <code>IntegerVector</code>, will now give warnings if you use
      <code>#define RCPP_WARN_ON_COERCE</code> before including the Rcpp
      headers.
    </p></li>
    <li><p> Templated <code>List</code> containers, <code>ListOf&lt;T&gt;</code>, have been 
      introduced. When subsetting such containers, the return is assumed 
      to be of type T, allowing code such as 
      <code>ListOf&lt;NumericVector&gt; x; NumericVector y = x[0] + x[1] + x[2]</code>.
    </p> </li>
    <li><p> In a number of instances, returned results are protected and/or cast more carefully. </p> </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p> Changes in Rcpp Attributes </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p> Trailing line comments are now stripped by the attributes
      parser. This allows the parser to handle C++ source files
      containing comments inline with function arguments.
    </p> </li>
    <li><p> The <code>USE_CXX1X</code> environment variable is now defined by 
      the cpp11 plugin when R &gt;= 3.1. Two additional plugins have been
      added for use with C++0x (eg when using g++ 4.6.* as on Windows)
      as well as C++1y for compilers beginning to support the next
      revision of the standard; additional fallback is provided for
      Windows. 
    </p> </li>
    <li> <p><code>compileAttributes()</code> now also considers Imports: which
      may suppress a warning when running <code>Rcpp.package.skeleton()</code>.
    </p> </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
