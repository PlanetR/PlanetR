R 3.1.0 came out today. Among the (impressive and long as usual) <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/NEWS.html">list of changes</a> is
the added ability to specify <code>CXX_STD = CXX11</code> in order to get
C++11 (or the best available subset on older compilers).  This brings a
number of changes and opportunities which are frankly too numerous to be
discussed in this short post.  But it also permits us, at long last, to use <code>long
long</code> integer types.

<p></p>
For RcppCNPy, this means that we can finally cover NumPy integer data (along
with the double precision we had from the start) on all
platforms.  Python encodes these as an int64, and that type was unavailable
(at least in 32-bit OSs) until we got <code>long long</code> made available
to us by R.
So today I made the change to depend on R 3.1.0, and select C++11 which
allowed us to free the code from a number if <code>#ifdef</code> tests.  This
all worked out swimmingly and the new package has already been rebuilt for
Windows.

<p></p>
I also updated the vignette, and refreshed its look and feel. 
Full changes are listed below.

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Changes in version 0.2.3 (2014-04-10)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> <p> <code>src/Makevars</code> now sets <code>CXX_STD = CXX11</code> which also provides the <code>long long</code> type on all platforms, so integer file support is no longer conditional. </p> </li>
  <li> <p> Consequently, code conditional on <code>RCPP_HAS_LONG_LONG_TYPES</code> has been simplified and is no longer conditional. </p> </li>
  <li> <p> The package now depends on R 3.1.0 or later to allow this. </p> </li>
  <li><p> The vignette has been updated and refreshed to reflect this. </p> </li>
</ul>
