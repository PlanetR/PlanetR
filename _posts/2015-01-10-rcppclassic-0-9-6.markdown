<p>A maintenance release of RcppClassic, now at version 0.9.6, went out to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> today. This package provides a maintained version of the otherwise deprecated first Rcpp API; no new projects should use it.</p>
<p>No changes were in user-facing code. The <code>Makevars</code> file was change to accomodate a request by the CRAN Maintainer to keep it free of GNU Make extensions. At the same time, we overhauled the look and feel of the (very short) vignette. Build instructions were updated both in the vignette and in the included example package. Other accumulated changes since the last release were updates to the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> and <code>NAMESPACE</code> file as well two namespace-related R code updates.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/">CRANberries</a>, there is the set of changes relative to <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/2015/01/10#RcppClassic_0.9.6">the previous release</a>.</p>
<p>Questions, comments etc should go to the <a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rcpp-devel">rcpp-devel mailing list</a> off the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rcpp/">R-Forge page</a>.</p>
